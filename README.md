# Water Tracker

Build with GatsbyJS.

This is a small Progessive Web App created to help me keep track of my daily water intake.

On the home screen, the user can click the "Drink" button to add water the day's water count. In the settings page, the user can clear their count, change their daily goal, and their water cup size.
